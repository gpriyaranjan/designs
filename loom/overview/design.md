### 1.2 Core Design Philosophy

**Video-First Architecture**: Every component is optimized for video workloads, from storage patterns to network protocols to processing pipelines.

**Design Rationale**: Traditional communication platforms retrofit video capabilities onto text-based architectures, leading to performance bottlenecks. Our video-first approach ensures:
- Sub-2 second recording start times through optimized recording pipelines
- Efficient video processing with parallel transcoding workflows
- Global content delivery optimized for large video files
- Storage strategies designed for video lifecycle management

## 2. Functional Design Decisions

### 2.1 Recording Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Distributed Recording Coordination

**Design Decision**: Implement a centralized Recording Service that coordinates distributed recording sessions across multiple client platforms.

**Rationale**:
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensures identical recording behavior across Windows, macOS, Linux, and browser environments
- **Session Management**: Centralized state management for pause/resume, multi-segment recordings
- **Real-time Coordination**: WebSocket connections enable real-time status updates and control commands
- **Scalability**: Stateless service design allows horizontal scaling for concurrent recording sessions

**Technical Implementation**:
```yaml
Recording Service Architecture:

  - Concurrent Sessions: Support for 10,000+ simultaneous recordings
```

#### 2.1.2 Multi-Modal Recording Support

**Design Decision**: Support simultaneous screen, webcam, and audio recording with independent quality controls.

**Rationale**:
- **User Flexibility**: Different use cases require different recording modes (screen-only for tutorials, webcam-only for messages, combined for presentations)
- **Quality Optimization**: Independent encoding allows optimal quality/bandwidth trade-offs per stream
- **Bandwidth Management**: Adaptive quality based on network conditions and device capabilities

### 2.2 Video Processing Pipeline

#### 2.2.1 Parallel Processing Architecture
