# Atlassian API Gateway Architecture Design

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive architectural design for an API Gateway specifically tailored for Atlassian Services (Jira and Confluence). The design focuses on scalability, security, performance, and operational excellence in a cloud-native environment.

## Architecture Summary

The API Gateway serves as a centralized entry point for all API requests to Jira and Confluence services, providing:

- **Unified API Interface**: Single point of access for multiple Atlassian services
- **Hybrid Authentication**: Support for OAuth 2.0, API Keys, and SAML
- **Advanced Security**: Comprehensive security implementations including TLS, input validation, and CORS
- **High Performance**: Multi-layer caching and performance optimization strategies
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling capabilities with cloud-native deployment
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, error handling, and fallback mechanisms
- **Observability**: Complete monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing

## Key Features

### üîê Security & Authentication
- Multi-protocol authentication (OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, API Keys, SAML 2.0)
- Fine-grained authorization with RBAC and ABAC
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- TLS termination and mutual TLS for backend communication
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration

### ‚ö° Performance & Scalability
- Multi-layer caching strategy (L1: In-memory, L2: Redis, L3: CDN)
- Horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling
- Intelligent load balancing with health checks
- Connection pooling and resource optimization
- CDN integration for global performance

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Resilience
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault isolation
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation and fallback strategies
- Multi-region deployment with disaster recovery
- Health monitoring and automated recovery

### üìä Observability & Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics collection with Grafana dashboards
- Structured logging with ELK stack integration
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- SLI/SLO monitoring and error budget management
- Real-time alerting and incident response

### üöÄ DevOps & Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins
- Kubernetes-native deployment with Helm charts
- Blue-green and canary deployment strategies
- Automated testing and quality gates
